# Portfolio_JG
## Description
This project is a showcase of my existing works in Ceramics and 3D while I am still navigating with my coding journey. Harnessing the power of grid and flexbox, this webpage aims to create a clean layout with legible fonts in order to give emphasis to the works in the pictures. There are several clickable elements within the page which will direct you to my artist's website and other external links such as GitHub, LinkedIn and Spotify.
